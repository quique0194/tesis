\begin{abstract}
Reinforcement Learning now has more attention due to the introduction of Deep Q Network. As a result there are many investigation lines currently. In the other hand, RoboCup has a soccer simulation 2D category that stimulates and let test new ideas in the field of artificial intelligence. In this work we propose the creation of a simulated soccer team using Deep Q Network algorithm. This is interesting and challenging because we have to use cooperative learning techniques from multiagent systems as well. This way, we hope to get a little bit closer to reach the goal of RoboCup: to play with the world champion soccer team with a robotic team in 2050 and win. In this work, we hope that our team plays at least better than a standard team called agent2d.
